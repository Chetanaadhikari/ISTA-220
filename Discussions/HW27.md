1. What is an enumerable collection?
It is a collection that implements the System.Collections.IEnumerable interface.

2. What properties and methods does the IEnumerable interface contain?
It contains a single method called GetEnumerator.

3. What properties and methods does the IEnumerator interface contain?
It specifies the following property and methods:
object Current { get; }
bool MoveNext();
void Reset();

4. What values does the MoveNext() method return? What does it do?
The MoveNext() method returns either true or false. 

5. What values does the Reset() method return? What does it do?
This method does not return a value. It is used to return the pointer back to before the first item in the list.

6. Are IEnumerable and IEnumerator type safe? Why or why not? If not, how do you implement type safety?
The Current property of the IEnumerator interface exhibits non-type-safe behavior. This is because it returns an object rather than a specific type.
 
9. What is an iterator?
An iterator is a block of code that yields an ordered sequence of values. 

10.What does yield do?
The yield keyword indicates the value that should be returned by each iteration.
